# Real World Security Cases

This repository contains write ups based on **real-world observations** and **responsible security thinking**.

The goal is not exploitation, but understanding.

## Why this repository exists

While studying cybersecurity, I realized something important:

Many real security issues are not found in labs or scanners.  
They appear in everyday systems, through small details and wrong assumptions.

This repository exists to:
- apply in practice what I’ve been studying
- document real logic flaws and edge cases
- think like an attacker, but act responsibly
- contribute, even in a small way, to a safer internet

---

## What you’ll find here

- Business logic flaws
- Trust issues between client and server
- Design assumptions that break under edge cases
- Scenarios discovered through observation, not exploitation

These are not “hacks” in the traditional sense.  
They are **logic problems**.

---

## Responsible approach

All cases documented here follow these principles:
- No abuse of vulnerabilities
- No step by step exploitation
- No disclosure of sensitive or identifying details
- Responsible reporting when applicable

When needed, application names and details are anonymized.

The focus is learning, not damage.

---

## Why this matters

Security isn’t only about:
- payloads
- exploits
- tools

It’s about:
- how systems think
- what they trust
- and where those assumptions fail

Many high impact issues start exactly here.

## Final thoughts

This repository reflects how I approach cybersecurity:

With curiosity.  
With responsibility.  
And with the intention of making systems better, not weaker.

If one documented case helps prevent a real world issue, it already served its purpose.
